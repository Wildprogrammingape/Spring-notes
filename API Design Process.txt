1. Review API requirements

2. Identify main resource / entity

3. ** Use HTTP methods to assign action on resource


创建一个Spring REST项目，实现CRUD actions。不同Http method对应不同的CRUD功能，是一个real-time project


POST(Http Method) --- /api/customers(Endpoint)	        --- Create a new customer   (CRUD action)
GET		 --- /api/customers 		        --- Read customers
GET 		--- /api/customers/{customersId}   --- Read a customer by id
PUT		--- /api/customers		        --- Update an existing customer
DELETE	                --- /api/customers/{customersId}   --- Delete an existing  customer by id
